```

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Glass Navigator is straightforward to use. You will find the navigation menu on the left side of the screen, and clicking on each item will smoothly scroll to the respective section. The glass morphism design ensures a visually appealing experience.
